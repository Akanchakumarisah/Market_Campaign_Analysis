📊 Market Campaign Analysis (R Language)

🧠 Overview
The Market Campaign Analysis project focuses on understanding customer behavior, identifying key factors influencing campaign success, and providing actionable insights for marketing strategy improvement.
Using R language, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to evaluate the performance of a marketing campaign dataset.


🎯 Objectives
Analyze customer demographics and behavior patterns.
Identify factors influencing the success of marketing campaigns.
Visualize relationships between customer attributes and response rates.
Build predictive models to estimate campaign effectiveness.

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and duplicates.
Converted categorical variables into factors.
Scaled numerical attributes for better model performance.
Removed outliers using IQR method.


📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed age, income, spending score, and campaign responses.
Created histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
Discovered key insights such as:
Customers with mid-to-high income respond more positively.
Married customers and those with children have lower engagement rates.
Previous campaign success is strongly correlated with current response rate.



🤖 Predictive Modeling
Built models to predict whether a customer will respond to a marketing campaign.
Models used:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Decision Tree

Evaluated using metrics like:
Accuracy
Precision & Recall
F1 Score
ROC-AUC

Best Model: Random Forest with highest accuracy and balanced recall–precision performance.


📊 Key Visualizations
Customer distribution by age and income
Response rate across marital status and education
Correlation heatmap between numeric variables
Feature importance from Random Forest model

📑 Insights & Recommendations
Focus on mid-income working professionals — they show higher conversion rates.
Personalized campaigns for loyal customers increase success probability.
Reducing over-contact with the same customers prevents negative responses.
Targeted email campaigns outperform mass campaigns.
